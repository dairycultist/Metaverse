# Metaverse

a single accessible VR world project

a bunch of games/worlds unified by a hub and in-game currency (metacoin). the games benefit from seeing in 3D (for immersion), but don't require head rotation tracking, and play well with a controller (like a driving sim or an FPS or something somewhat hotter). legit just lie down, plug yourself in (to charger + headphones) and go into the metaverse. also [godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html)

requires:
- the phone vr thing
- console controller connected to phone
- optionally headphones
- ability to export game to phone hehe

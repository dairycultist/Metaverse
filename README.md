# Metaverse

a sit-down VR world project

A bunch of games/worlds unified by a hub and in-game currency (metacoin). The games benefit from seeing in 3D (for immersion), but don't require head rotation tracking, and play well with a controller (like a driving sim or an FPS or something somewhat hotter).
